# Frontend Pro Challenger - Landing Page

The Frontend Pro Challenger Landing Page is an intermediate challenging project where I explored advanced front-end skills to create an attractive and functional web page. I used HTML, Sass, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Font Awesome Pro icons to enhance the user experience.
